# Face Morphing Algorithms

This reposiotry is a part of my research regrarding Face Morphing. This includes links, python notebooks and scripts used for experimental Face Morphing Generation and Detection. I also used open source code. Check the references and sources for details.

## Details

### What is face morphing


## Usage

### Requirements
It is advised to use a [Python virtual enviroment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda/miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). The version of Python used is ```3.11.2```.

```
$ python3 -m venv morphenv
$ source morphenv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
